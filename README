Introduction
------------

This is a very simple "dice rolling" game that displays six die with standard 1-6 values and allows the user to roll the dice to generate new values.

The app does nothing other than roll the dice currently.

In order to roll the dice, shake the device and then hold it still. The dice will roll.

Provided Files
--------------

This app targets iOS 5 and has minimal testing. I have provided all of the files needed to load up this project in xcode and run the app. You'll need a developer license to be able to run it on a device.

Future Considerations
---------------------

I have some ideas about possible improvements to this little demo including:

1. Creating a settings page where you can change the number of dice, how many rotations occur, etc.
2. Make the dice begin rolling when the user begins shaking the phone and continue rolling while the dice are being shook, returning to the original position only when the user stops shaking.
